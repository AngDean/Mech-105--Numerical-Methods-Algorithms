# Gas Tank Homework Problem

This algorithm was created for a homework problem given by my professor. The problem involved a created gas tank with an inverted frustum and cylinder combined. The user would nomrally input the height of the fuel in the tank, but the h will be equal to 20 for the homework problem. The goal of this algorithm is to find the volume of the liquid in the tank. The problem had set values, but the code will allow the user to change the height of the fuel, the diameter of the biggest part of the inverted fustrum, the diameter of the cylinder, and the constant height, h, of the cylinder.
