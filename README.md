# Mech 105: Numerical Methods Algorithms
## This repository contains algorithms created for a numerical methods class. Most of the algorithms are functions and one algorithm is for a homework problem.
### Functions Contained in Repository
1. days
2. falsePosition
3. luFactor
4. Simpson
### Homework Problem Contained in Repository
1. Gas Tank Homework Problem

## Note
Some of these algorithms were designed based off of similar algorithms in my numerical textbook.
