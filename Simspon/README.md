#Simpson Algorithm

This alrogrithm is a function that numerically evaluates the integral of the vector of function values 'y' with respect to 'x'. The function will use Simpson's 1/3 rule. If the arrays given have an odd number of intervals, the trapezoidal rule will be used for the last interval and will give a warning to the user. The function has the syntax of I = Simpson(x,y). X is an array containing x values of an area of integration. Y is an array containing function values of the x values. I is the value of the integral.
