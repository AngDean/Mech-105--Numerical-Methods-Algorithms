# days Algorithm
This algorithm is a function that will calculate how many days has passed since the first day of the new year. The algorithm requires the user to input data in the syntax of days(mo,da,leap). The inputs are mo, da, and leap. mo is the current month. da is the current day of the month. leap indicates if the current year is a leap year or not. If it is a leap year the user is supposed to enter 1. If it is not a leap year the user is supposed to enter 0. The output is nd which is the value of how many days have occured since the start of the new year.

## Note
This function was created when I was learning how to write functions, so it is not a nicely written function.
