# falsePosition Algorithm

This algorithm is a function that will have a user input an equation and the function will locate the roots of the equation. The user will have to input a lower and an upper guess of where a root is located. The lower and upper guess must have a sign change. The function has the syntax [root,fx,ea,iter] = falsePosition(func,Xl,Xu,es,maxiter). The inputs are func, Xl, Xu, ex, and maxiter. func is the equation being evaluated. Xl is the lower guess and Xu is the upper guess. es is the desired relative error. If the user does not input a relative error, the function will default to an error of 0.00001%. maxiter is the number of iterations desired. If the user does not input a max number of iterations, the function will default to 200. The outputs are root, fx, ea, and iter. root is the estimated root of the function. fx is the function evaluated at the root location. ea is the approximate relative error. iter is how many iterations were performed.
