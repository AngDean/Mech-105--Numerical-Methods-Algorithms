# luFactor Algorithm

The algorithm has the syntax of [L,U,P] = luFactor(A). A is the coefficients of a matrix from a system of euqations. L is the lower triangular matrix. U is the upper triangular matrix. P is the pivot matrix. The algorithm is a function designed to determine the LU Factorization of a square matrix by breaking up A into a lower and upper triangular matrix. This function should be able to do any size square matrix and be able to do partial pivoting. In the end, the matrices multiplied together (L*U and P*A) should equal each other. L*U = P*A. If you wanted to find the actual values of the variables you begin back-substituion, but will need what the systems of equations equate to.
